# Monroe-Project-2022

In this project, I am looking at a square stochastic matrix A. The entries of A are non-negative and between zero and one. A is a square matrix, meaning it has an equal number of rows and columns. The number of rows is designated as n and is equal to the number of columns. With these conditions in mind, I am analyzing the trends of the equation (∝*A + (1-∝)*I). This equation transforms a non-negative stochastic matrix into a row diagonal dominant stochastic matrix. ∝ is also known as alpha and runs from 0 to 1/2 in the equation, averaging the original matrix, A, with the identiy matrix. The dynamic nature of alpha means that there is a different weight placed on the identity vs the original matrix at any time. The main concerns of this research will look at the resulting diagonal values of the inverse, the derivitives of those diagonal values, and other trends to better understand the behavior of row diagonal dominant stochastic matrices. The trends of this equation and the type of matrices it creates are significant in the real world in modeling techniques for economics and could prove to be useful in many other fields.

# Monroe-Project-2022

In this project, I am looking at a square stochastic matrix A. The entries of A are non-negative and between zero and one. It has the same number of entries in its rows and columns. With this in mind, I am trying to analyze the trends of this equation: (∝*A + (1-∝)*I). The main condition for this equation is that 0 <= ∝ <= ½. The trends of this equation are significant in the real world in modeling techniques for economics and could prove to be useful in many other fields.
